Rulesets can be used for use-cases (e.g. to support auto merging of pull requests) that can not be modelled with Branch Protection Rules:

- define a set of required status checks
- define a set of users that can bypass pull requests

Branch Protection Rules always consider the required status checks, even when directly pushing to the branch, e.g. when no pull request
is required, or you can push due to a bypass allowance. This can be modelled with Rulesets though, as the bypass actors as defined for a Ruleset
are taken into account for all settings (except `allows_force_pushes`), while the bypass allowance for Branch Protection Rules only apply for
pull requests in general.

## Jsonnet Function

``` jsonnet
orgs.newRepoRuleset('<name>') {
  <key>: <value>
}
```

## Validation rules

- setting `enforcement` to `evaluate` for an organization on a non `enterprise` plan triggers an error
- setting `target` must be one of `branch`, `tag` or `push`, any other value triggers an error
- enabling a setting that is only taken into account when another setting is enabled, triggers a warning, e.g. `dismisses_stale_reviews` is only valid when `requires_pull_request` is enabled
- specifying an integer value for `required_approving_review_count` while `requires_pull_request` is disabled, triggers a warning, set it to `null` instead

## Example usage

=== "jsonnet"
    ``` jsonnet
    orgs.newOrg('adoptium') {
      ...
      _repositories+:: [
        ...
        orgs.newRepo('adoptium.net') {
          description: "Adoptium Website",
          homepage: "https://adoptium.net",
          ...
          rulesets: [
            orgs.newRepoRuleset('main') {
              bypass_actors+: [
                "@adoptium/project-leads",
              ],
              include_refs+: [
                "~DEFAULT_BRANCH"
              ],
              required_approving_review_count: 0,
              required_merge_queue: orgs.newMergeQueue() {
                merge_method: "REBASE"
              }
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    }
