## Validation rules

- enabling either `dependabot_alerts_enabled_for_new_repositories` or `dependabot_security_updates_enabled_for_new_repositories` also requires enabling `dependency_graph_enabled_for_new_repositories`
- enabling `dependabot_security_updates_enabled_for_new_repositories` also requires enabling `dependabot_alerts_enabled_for_new_repositories`
- enabling `has_discussions` also requires setting `discussion_source_repository` to a valid repository to host the discussions

## Example usage

=== "jsonnet"
    ``` jsonnet
    orgs.newOrg('adoptium') {
        settings+: {

            default_repository_permission: "none",
